<h1 align="center">Synk 🔮</h1>

<p align="center">
  A sensory playground to explore <b>synesthesia</b> — where sound has color, words have taste, and touch can trick the mind. <br>
  Built in SwiftUI for an <b>immersive, interactive experience</b>.
</p>

## Features  

- 🎨 **Color Mapping**  
 Choose colors that best match your feelings in a series of intuitive, visual tests.  

- 🍬 **Word–Flavor Association**  
  Explore how names and words can evoke imagined tastes and textures.  

- 🧬 **Synesthetic Profile**  
 At the end, receive a personalized profile with your dominant colors, patterns, and a generated abstract form. 

- ✋  **Tactile Illusionse**  
  Interact with virtual surfaces (smooth, bumpy, sharp, rough) using haptic feedback and touch-based illusions.
